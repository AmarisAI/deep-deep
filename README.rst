Deep-Deep: Adaptive Crawler
===========================

Deep-Deep is a Scrapy-based crawler which uses Reinforcement Learning methods
to learn which links to follow.

It is called Deep-Deep, but it doesn't use Deep Learning, and it is not only
for Deep web. Weird.

Testing
-------

To run tests, execute the following command from the source root::

    ./runtests.sh

It requires Python 3.5+.
