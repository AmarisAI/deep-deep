Scheduling
==========

There are several conflicting goals which scheduler needs to acheive.
It should:

1. prefer to crawl all domains;
2. prefer more promising links;
3. allow less promising links to be crawled with some probability
   (Îµ-greedy policy);
4. allow to update link priorities dynamically.

For each domain there is a priority queue for requests.
To select next link crawler first chooses a domain, then chooses
a link for this domain. It allows to crawl all domains and prioritise
more promising requests.

2. If some kind of forms is common and many links lead to these forms
   then link scores would be high for this kind of forms for most links.
   This is a problem if some domain doesn't have these forms at all.
   Example: let's say 80% of websites have search forms on each page.
   So classifier learned to assign each link 0.8 score on average.
   If a domain doesn't have a search form then the reward for most links
   will be a high number of 0.8, and so crawler can spend most time trying
   to find a search form instead of trying to solve other tasks.

Choosing domain to crawl
------------------------

For each domain crawler maintains a score - max expected reward.
Next domain to crawl is selected randomly, with a probability proportional
to this score - more promising domain is, more often it is selected.
